                Hello!I’m Divya Garigipati, a Master’s student in Information Technology and Management at the Illinois
                Institute of Technology. My academic journey and work experiences have given me a well-rounded skill set
                in technology and communication.I have a foundational knowledge of HTML and CSS, which has allowed me to
                get started with creating and designing basic web pages. This knowledge complements my work with JavaFX
                for desktop applications and my proficiency in data visualization tools like PowerBI.
                In my current role as a Front Desk Assistant at the Student Employment Office at Illinois Tech, I’ve
                developed strong communication skills and gained valuable experience in a professional setting. This
                role has also involved creating data dashboards and supporting event planning, further enhancing my
                analytical and organizational abilities.
                I’m excited to apply my technical skills and enthusiasm for technology to new challenges and
                opportunities.</p>
